                Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snaphsot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshots you took or merge those expereiments into the your app.

                </h3>
                <p class ="alltext">
                Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.
